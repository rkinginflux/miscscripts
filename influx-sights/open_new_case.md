Hello $CUSTOMER!

This is a short message to let you know we offer a free service called “Influx-Insights”. It’s a monitoring service that sends telemetry to our cloud service and will alert you when there’s an issue. 

Types of alerts

CPU Usage
Node Memory Usage
Telegraf IOStat
HH (Hinted Handoff)

If you are interested in using Influx-InSights, let me know, and I can send you the telegraf config files for your Data, Meta, & Kach nodes along with setup instructions. And if you are not interested in Influx-InSights, please let me know. Take care!


Best Regards,
